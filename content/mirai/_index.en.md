# Mirai

MIRAI is a program conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA)
and brings together young Europeans and Japanese students with the aim of
disseminating Japanese culture and building bridges between Japanese and
European cultures. I took part in its 2021-2022 edition. However, the main part
of the program, a trip to japan alongside other European students, could not be
carried out due to Covid. Regardless, I greatly enjoyed the online activities
carried out during the program.

In this page, I documented some of these. Also, MoFA does the great job of
organising online conferences for MIRAI alumni, as well as allowing us to attend
some of the virtual events organised for each year's MIRAI student cohort.
Therefore, I also list here some of these alumni events.

Events usually take the form of 1h-1h30m talks on Japanese affairs by
knowledgeable individuals appointed by MoFA, followed by a short discussion time
amongst Alumni in small groups.

I would like this page to serve for encouraging university students to apply to
this program. Selection usually takes place at the start of the academic year,
may be conducted only by the Japanese embassy in each country, or in a two-level
manner, by the embassy and the student's home university. You may count on an
essay, a motivation letter, and, if everything goes well, an interview with
people from the embassy. However, specific requirements may vary on a
year-by-year basis, so be sure to check those out!
