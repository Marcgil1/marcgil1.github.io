# Mirai

MIRAI is a program conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA)
and brings together young Europeans and Japanese students with the aim of
disseminating Japanese culture and building bridges between Japanese and
European cultures. I took part in its 2021-2022 edition. However, the main part
of the program, a trip to japan alongside other European students, could not be
carried out due to Covid. Regardless, I greatly enjoyed the online activities
carried out during the program.

In this page, I documented some of these. Also, MoFA does the great job of
organising online conferences for MIRAI alumni, as well as allowing us to attend
some of the virtual events organised for each year's MIRAI student cohort.
Therefore, I also list here some of these alumni events.
