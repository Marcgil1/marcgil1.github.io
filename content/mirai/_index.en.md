# MIRAI

MIRAI is a program conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
brings together young Europeans and Japanese students with the aim of
disseminating Japanese culture and building bridges between Japanese and
European cultures.

I took part on it during the year 2021-2022. Even though, the central part of the
program, a trip to Japan alongside other European students, could not be carried
out due to the Covid pandemic, program organisers have started preparing the
trip for 2023, so this site may contain then some info on it by then.

Actually, this page contains several entries commenting on the MIRAI Alumni
events that eventually take place online. These usually involve a lecture on
some topic related to Japan and discussion on the topics introduced among the
fellow alumni.
