Last saturday a MIRAI alumni event took place, consisting in a lecture on the
evolution of graphic arts in Japan by professor Atsushi Hosogaya from the Tokyo
Polytechnic University.

Even though the word *manga* might immediately bring to mind the famous Japanese
graphic novels, similar in format to a comic, the term itself is quite old, with
roots usually traced back to the scroll *Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga*, dating from the
XIIth-XIIIth centuries. This was professor Hosogaya's thesis, argumented by
tracing the historical evolution of this artistic branch ranging from the
aforementioned scroll, shown in the image below, to modern *manga*.
