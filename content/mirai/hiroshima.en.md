Today, a MIRAI alumni event took place regarding Hiroshima's bombing as exposed
by Mr. Shin Fukuhara, grandson of two survivors. Probably the most striking
thing about Mr. Fukuhara's talk was its complete absence of hatred towards
Americans. That feeling could be seen as the most natural reaction after such a
thraumatic event. However, Japanese people have employed this historical fact
for extracting a much more mature conclusion: such hatred would be worse than
useless, for it would lead to further conflict and nothing in return. Instead,
Mr. Fukuhara emphasized the diligent work of Hiroshima's people in
reconstructing their hometown, the building of bridges between with other
nations done by post-war Japan, and the necessity of learning from the bombing
that peace should be a prime goal for mankind.

A lesson that today is particularly relevant.
