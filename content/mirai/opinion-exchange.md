Today we had an special session within the MIRAI Alumni program. Instead of the
usual lecture + group discussion setting, we hosted a sort of inverted meeting,
in which three fellow MIRAI Alumni reflected on their experiences within the
program. These were Emma Beljeri, from Italy, Dado Dervanovic, from Montenegro,
and Emilio GÃ³mez Marfil, from Spain (!). After taht, professors KOMATSU Taro,
from Sophia University, and HASHIDA Tsutomu, form the University of Kobe,
reflected on the alumni's presentations, posted some open questions on the
outcomes of the MIRAI program and suggested some points for improvement.
