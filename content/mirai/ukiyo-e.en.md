On March the 11th I participated in a quite interesting talk by Ms. Yukiko
Takahashi, from Takahashi Kobo, a Ukiyo-e studio in Tokio, during a MIRAI alumni
meeting. This studio was founded 160 years ago during the Edo period, and
preserves the printing techniques from those times. Ms. Takahashi took us on a
(virtual) tour in the studio, and we were able to watch how a reproduction of
Hokusai's *Great Wave* was made. However impressive this was, which is to say
quite a lot, what I found most interesting was Ms. Takahashi's comments on
several Ukiyo-e prints, indicating that there are in them many things to learn
from the life in Japan during the Edo period.
