Today, a lecture took place for MIRAI alumni took place on the history and
activities of the Japanese Space Agency. We had the pleasure to join Mr. YOSHIDA
Ryota, advisor to the director of international relations of JAXA, who commented
on the history, present, and future endeavours of this Japanese organisation.

Even though JAXA was established on 2003, the land of the rising sun has been
involved in space exploration for some 70 years, first efforts being traceable
to Dr. STOKAWA Hideo. Early successes include OSHIMI (1970), the first Japanese
satellite.

Currently, JAXA has 6 satellites in operation, and 4 others under development.
This very month, they launched H3, a heavy rocket. Mr. YOSHIDA says that the
team in charge of H3 is currently centered in improving the current single-use
launch system, but that they consider reusability such as that of Spacex'
rockets as a sensible next step.

Other interesting project concerns the removal of Space debris, in the frame of
which the ADRAS-J spacecraft was launched on Frebruary 18. This spacecraft is in
charge of removing a dead Japanese rocket from orbit.

As usual, after the lecture we joined small rooms for discussing the topics
introduced by Mr. YOSHIDA. I could chat for some minutes with Adam DUHAJ and
Drin Morina, both participants of the 2023 program. We commented on the
blosoming space industry that is originating worldwide, and argued that Japan's
economy is well positioned for joining this movement. On this matter, I
particularly recall the rich space industry that I've seen both in Spain and in
the Great Duchy.
