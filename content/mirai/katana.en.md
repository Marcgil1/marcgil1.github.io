Last week, the Online Visiting program for 2023-2024 MIRAI participants started.
This means that we, alumni, were also able to participate in some of the
organised lectures. Particularly, this morning we were introduced to the art and
craft of Japanese swordmaking.

In this lecture, a documentary was displayed providing a summary of the process
of japanese swordmaking. After that, we had the opportunity of posing questions
to a sword craftsman who also reflected on his subject. As usual in these
sessions, after the actual lecture, alumni were got divided into smaller groups
for discussing about the program.
