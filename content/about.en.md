I recently graduated in a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at
the University of Murcia, in Murcia, Spain.

I really enjoyed the rare possibility of getting an overall view of two
different subjects: Maths and CS. Actually, I found that the logical reasoning
exercised in the study of mathematics is quite relevant for the design of good
code. And bachelor-level knowledge of some areas, such as statistics and
calculus, really made a difference when understanding AI concepts.

As extracurricular activities, I continued working at the intersection of these
two fields. On one side, I got really interested in Competitive Programming,
being able to represent my university in several national (AdaByron, Madrid) and
international (SWERC, Milano) contests. On the other side, I worked as a student
researcher during 2019-2020, working on Reinforcement Learning, a subfield
within Machine Learning; and during the Summer of 2022 and the academic year
2022-2023, working on ACO, a nature-inspired metaheuristic for solving the TSP.
The focus in these last two internships was on finding high-performant
resolution methods. This work eventually evolved to be my end-of-degree thesis
in Computer Science.

Amongst my hobbies, I may count the following:
- Learning foreign languages. I find the process of gradually getting some
  meaning out of an earlier-undecypherable sequence of words quite rewarding on
  itself. Also, languages never are isolated constructs â€“ learning one
  invariably implies getting to know the culture associated with it, which is
  also quite rewarding.
- Reading. My interests are quite varied, but main focus points include Spanish
  Philology, History, Phylosophy, and Spanish classical literature.
- Films. This interest area is far more heterogeneous, including Kubrik,
  Kurosawa, and, above all, the magnificent films of the Spaniard Berlanga.
  Mostly the _National Triology_. This is comprised of three comedies full of
  wit that reflect part of the Spanish society of the late 20th century.
- Finally, I may mention that I avidly watch the insightful conferences given by
  the _Juan March_ Foundation [[link](https://canal.march.es/es)]. Everything
  under that link is in Spanish, but the Foundation also offers an English podcast
  about major Spanish figures
