In this introduction we will explain what these concepts mean.\nA rule-based system serves as a logical-deduction machine, being given as input some facts and some logical rules relating these facts, so that we may check whether a given conclussion holds. For example, suppose we are given the following rules:\nIF shinyDay AND haveTimeForPrograming, THEN iAmInAGoodMood IF shinyDay, THEN itsHotOutside If we know that today it is shiny, we may say that shinyDay holds, and, by the second rule above, itsHotOutside also holds. However, if we don\u0026rsquo;t know that haveTimeForProgramming also holds, we cannot infer that iAmInAGoodMood, for not all premises in the first rule hold. A rule-based system follows a similar reasoning for answering questions in this framework.\nHowever, this scheme is unsuitable for many situations, because not every deduction follows the simple schema of A IMPLIES B. Certainty factors try to introduce the concept of degree of belief, so that we may represent the case in which a fact holds with some certainty. For instance, we may say today its 80% shiny, which may be more accurate than saying it\u0026rsquo;s 100% shiny. Furthermore, we may quantify the degree of certainty we have in the validity of some rule, so that the second rule above could be\nIF shinyDay, THEN itsHotOutside, with 70% certainty The rule-based system implemented in this project includes certainty factors for determining the degree of certainty with which a conclussion holds given some facts, some inference rules, and the degree of confidence in both facts and rules.\nUses #Rule-based systems are suitable for situations in which some decissions must be taken according to some available data and to some previouly-recorded rules. For instance, they may be used in the medical domain, for determining the best treatment for some patient provided his pathologies and symptoms. The key requirement is the availability of previously recorded expert knowledge.\nThese systems have the great advantage of being highly interpretable. That is, we may check the reasoning followed for arriving to some conclussion.\n","date":"28 June 2022","permalink":"/projects/rule-based-system/","section":"","summary":"You may find this project here.","title":"Rule-Based System"},{"content":"I’m currently a student for Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Murcia, in Murcia, Spain.\nI am interested in Mathematical Optimisation and High Performance Computing.

When finishing the game, it receives either a reward of +1 if the play was won, a penalty of -1 if it lost, or 0 if got to stalemate, thus being able to decide how beneficial the decisions taken were.\nIn this repo, there are implementations for some of the basic algorithms of Deep RL, an area combining RL with Deep Learning.\nAll implementations are based on an Agent class presenting methods for:\nTaking an action given some observation.

It being developed 2 years ago means that code quality, even though decent, could be better. In particular, functions should follow the 1-screen rule (all their code should fit within 1 screen), and thus the present ones should further subdivide their functionality amongst several other subprocedures. Furthermore, C being C, Valgrind should be used for checking whether there are any memory leaks. Despite all of this, the code itself is quite neat and easy to read. I hope that the following introduction to the project, as well as the code itself, will support this assertion.\nIntroduction #The present proyect aims to develop a simple, yet functional, web server. For this matter, the server includes capabilities for handling GET request, code being modular enough for easily being extended to handle other request types.\nIn its current form, the code cosists of (1) an entry point listening to the relevan socket and reading information, (2) an HTTP module for parsing HTTP requests, (3) a debug module including functionality for creating logs during the execution of the server, and (4) a resource folder which is to be inputed as a paramater to the server executable and which contains the web content to be served. This content may have any MIME type whatsoever, and the default content stored in content/web contains a sample web page including HTML, CSS and JS files, as well as a favicon and a couple of images.\nFurthermore, this project abides to the requirements of the course for which it was developed, which were for it to be implemented in ANSI C, and to store a cookie in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser holding the number of times the webpage was visited. Should the user visit the webpage for more than this number of times, an error message would be sent as response.\nHow to execute the server #In order to execute the server, clone the repository linked above, and execute make build and make start this will build the program and execute it over the 8080 port serving the sample webpage stored in resources/web. If you want the server to run on any other port or to server content in some other folder, just run make build and then call build/out/main.out [port] [folder]. Logs created during execution are stored in resources/log/webserver.log.\nThe current makefile also includes functionality for running unit tests on the coder. For this matter, run make build_test and make test.\nA comment on the implementation #Modularity #An effort has been made for separating logical functionality of the code between different modules. In particular, all functionality for representing and parsing HTTP requests has been abstracted into an http module. This enables separation of concerns and facilitates unit testing. Furthermore, the chosen approach of structuring the module arround the processing of three data types, http_req_t, http_res_t, and http_cookie_t, in addition to being conceptually pleasant, lends itself to a very OOP style. Of course, to the extent to which C allows.\nIf further work were to be carried on the project, one further milestone in this direction would be to abstract all the socket operations into a server module, which would also offer a good opportunity for refining that code. Furthermore, it would be nice to investigate whether any C libraries allow mocking the socket functionality, since this would greatly simplify testing of this proposed new module.\nUnit Testing #Unit tests have been implemented for code in the http module leveraging the UNITY unit testing library. This is a particularly neat and light-weight library whose only requirement on the testing code is to start it by calling UNITY_BEGIN in a main function, and then defining and running tests with the macro RUN_TEST.\nLogging #All logging functionality has been abstracted into a debug module offering dg_log, dg_wrn and dg_err-level logging. Also, it was decided that this module would hold the logging file as a global variable. This choice was taken with the folowing considerations in mind:\nThis approach leads to a particularly simple implementation, its only overhead other than calling the log functions being indicating a path to the log file and closing it once finished. Should the server become parallel (which is currently not), this approach would lead to race conditions when writing the logs, since the logging file would then be a shared resource. Should one want to make this server parallel, some access control mechanism would have to be implemented in order to avoid race conditions. Further work #I can see three main lines over which this project may be extended. Roughly in order of importance, these would be:\nMaking the code more modular by abstracting all external communication into a server module. Extend the code for also handling other types of HTTP requests. Make the server parallel, by holding a pool of threads to be assigned to specific requests, so that several users may be served concurrently.
