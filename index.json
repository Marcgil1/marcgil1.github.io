[{"content":"I’m currently a student for Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Murcia, in Murcia, Spain.\nI am interested in Mathematical Optimisation and High Performance Computing. I have also an interest for AI, concretely for an area known as Reinforcement Learning.\nI also enjoy Competitive Programming, having participated in SWERC (a competition on the southern-european level). In these competitions, some computational problems must be solved; the main focus being the use of efficient (and pertinent) algorithms and data structures.\nSimultaneously studying both degrees is a quite time-consuming task, so most of the time I’m studying. When I’m not, then I’m probably doing some of the following:\nI really enjoy learning foreign languages. I find the process of gradually getting some meaning out of an earlier-undecypherable sequence of words quite rewarding on itself. Also, languages never are isolated constructs – learning one invariably implies getting to know the culture associated with it, which is also quite rewarding. Reading, being as avid a reader as time allows. Watching films.

An example of this would be an agent playing chess: At each timestep, the agent may choose to take an action (moving a piece), thus alterating its environment (changing the state of the board). When finishing the game, it receives either a reward of +1 if the play was won, a penalty of -1 if it lost, or 0 if got to stalemate, thus being able to decide how beneficial the decisions taken were.\nIn this repo, there are implementations for some of the basic algorithms of Deep RL, an area combining RL with Deep Learning.\nAll implementations are based on an Agent class presenting methods for:\nTaking an action given some observation. Observing the result of the taken action.

This studio was founded 160 years ago during the Edo period, and preserves the printing techniques from those times. Ms. Takahashi took us on a (virtual) tour in the studio, and we were able to watch how a reproduction of Hokusai\u0026rsquo;s Great Wave was made. However impressive this was, which is to say quite a lot, what I found most interesting was Ms. Takahashi\u0026rsquo;s comments on several Ukiyo-e prints, indicating that there are in them many things to learn from the life in Japan during the Edo period.\nPreparing the print for Hokusai\u0026rsquo;s The Great Wave Detail from The Great Wave ","date":"12 March 2022","permalink":"/mirai/ukiyo-e/","section":"","summary":"Ms Takahashi holding Utagawa Hiroshige\u0026rsquo;s Suidobashi Bridge and Surugadai On March the 11th I participated in a quite interesting talk by Ms.","title":"Ukiyo-e lecture"},{"content":" Participants in the Science and Technology Group On this saturday the 15th of january took place the first meeting among participants of the MIRAI program; which fosters the relations among Japan and Europe through a short exchange between students of both regions. Unfortunately is Japan, as the rest of the world, not exempt of Covid, so we will not be able to visit the Land of the Rising Sun in the immediate future. However, I do think the most important aspect of the program is that it allows us getting to know interesting people from both Europe and Japan, and the wealth of talks we will atend, ranging from the Japanese exterior policy to Japanese culture and costumes. And those are not going away with Covid.\nOn this first day, I got to know a few of my European fellows on the Science and Technology group, and found them to be really interesting people, with expertise ranging from undergraduate - like myself - to PhD\u0026rsquo;s, and summing up to an eclectic mix of study areas: Arquitecture, Genomics, Computer Science, \u0026hellip;\nTwo very sort talks were held: one by Mr. SAITO Atsushi, director of MoFA\u0026rsquo;s European Division, welcoming us to the program, and one by Mr. Stuart Varnam-Atkin, on understandig Japan.\n","date":"15 January 2022","permalink":"/mirai/hatsu-zoomu/","section":"","summary":"Participants in the Science and Technology Group On this saturday the 15th of january took place the first meeting among participants of the MIRAI program; which fosters the relations among Japan and Europe through a short exchange between students of both regions.","title":"Hatsu-zoomu"}]
