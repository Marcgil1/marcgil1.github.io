You may also find the associated code here. Even though this article is being writen and published in late 2023, the thesis was presented in May 2023, all code and source files dating from that time.\nIntroduction #This article introduces the end-of-degree thesis I completed in fulfillment of the requeriments for obtaining the bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in Mathematics at the University of Murcia. This work was supervised by Prof. Dr. Alfredo Marín, from the same institution.\nThe thesis verses on the Rank Pricing Problem (henceforth, RPP) a combinatorial optimisation problem consisting in determining the best possible way to price a given set of items in such a manner that the total profit for the retailer is maximised, while taking into account the preferences and budgets of a set of customers.\nResults presented in this thesis are adaptable to a number of use cases, most of them relating to supporting business leadership in pricing different models of a same type of product. Thus, using terminology currently in vogue, its main application case would be that of business intelligence; in particular, decission support. Practical ussage would require developing several generic user profiles by aggregating already existing customer behaviour data.\nFormal definition of the problem #The RPP presupposes the existence of a seller and of a set of clients. The seller offers various goods and wishes to prize them so as to maximise his benefits. In turn, each client is characterised by a list of preferences. These lists consist of products from those offered by the seller. Products in them are totally ordered, so that for each pair of distinct products \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\) in the preference list of some customer \\(k\\), either \\(i_1\\) is strictly better than \\(i_2\\) for \\(k\\), or \\(i_2\\) is strictly better than \\(i_1\\) for \\(k\\). Furthermore, each client has a budget, which is the maximum amount of money he can afford to expend. In this setting, the RPP is defined as the problem of determining for each client wishes one product of maximum preference for him whose price be less than or equal to his budget. From this assignment we may then trivially recover the seller\u0026rsquo;s profit.\nProject scope and individual contributions #In line with the standard procedure for master\u0026rsquo;s thesis in the University of Murcia, the work carried out during this project mainly consisted in synthetising an academic paper. In this case, the paper was due to Calvete et al. [2019], where the RPP was first introduced and studied.\nOther than reviewing the aforementioned paper, this thesis includes some individual contributions. In particular, the base study carried out by Calvete was expanded in order to deal with the Envy-free, Capacitated Rank Pricing Problem, in which we allow to define a limited ammount of products, in contrast to the standard Rank Pricing Probelm, which presupposes an unlimited supply of all items.\nA second individual contribution consisted in developing a code implementation of this problems by using the mathematical programming language AMPL. Furthermore, some computational studies were carried out on this novel version of the problem. In order to easy reproducibility, these studies were carried out programmatically through Python scripts made available alongside the AMPL code [here].\nDocument overview #The thesis is structured in five chapters:\nAn introduction to the fields of linear, integer, and bilevel programming, which are used for modelling the RPP. Furthermore, some concepts of Graph Theory are introduced which are necessary for giving theoretical evidence on the quality of the formulations presented later on. Some naive formulations of the RPP are introduced which follow the Bilevel Programming paradigm. They are used for deriving some other integer non-linear formulations which are more computationally tractable. This is a schema followed at several points in the thesis: deriving more computationally-tractable formulations from harder-to-solve ones. Chapter three continues improving the non-linear integer formulations obtained by the end of the last chapter by linearising them through inclussion of a novel set of variables. In fact, two natural ways of linearising the problem exist, each leading to a different linear formulation with its own set of variables. Both are presented and form the basis of the rest of the thesis. Furthermore, two algorithms are introduced for variable separation. These are used for speeding up the computational resolution of the previously-obtained formulations. This approach falls within the brach-and-cut approach to solving integer programming problems. Chapter four is a miutious study of a particular subproblem of the RPP: the Set Packing Subproblem. This is a well-known problem in Integer Programming, and some ingenious results due to Padberg [1973] are used for giving theoretical results giving a concrete picture of how tight restrictions in the presented formulations are. This is a theoretically-sound way of saying that the given formulations can be solved within a reasonable amount of time. Finally Chapter five concentrates all individual contributions. These include extending the previous work, which is due to Calvete et al. [2019], to an extension of the RPP which allows modelling the situation in which a seller wishes to sell some items which have stock limitations. For this matter, extensions of the formulations due to Calvete are developed. Furthermore, some computational studies are carried out assessing how the solving time for these formulations scales with the problem size. Code overview #Source files for this project are grossly divided into two main classes: first, AMPL files defining the several models considered; second, Python scripts automating the various aspects of the computational study which the model files will be subject to.\nScripts follow a convention I developed some time ago automating the different stages of a project. This simply consists of having a directory mk under which to store several scripts automating repetitive actions. This is a bit more flexible than having makefiles, since we get all the expressive power of our interpreter of choice, be that Python, a shell, or any other. Indeed, this is an idea which is quite far from being revolutionary, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found that its simplicity makes it preferable to more complex tools like Gradle or Maven whenever these may be avoided.\nAnyway, the project implements two main scripts: mk/gendata and mk/run. The first one randomly generates entry data in the format expected by AMPL and stores it in the data folder. The second script iterates over this folder and automates execution of the solver, as well as generation of graphs and LaTeX tables.\nCode dependencies. #The code depends for execution on:\nThe Rich Python library [pip link]. The Amplpy Pyhton library [pip link]. Having a correct installation of AMPL in the executing machine. Bibliography # Calvete, H. I., Domínguez, C., Galé, C., Labbé, M., and Marín, A. (2019).

In this introduction we will explain what these concepts mean.\nA rule-based system serves as a logical-deduction machine, being given as input some facts and some logical rules relating these facts, so that we may check whether a given conclussion holds. For example, suppose we are given the following rules:\nIF shinyDay AND haveTimeForPrograming, THEN iAmInAGoodMood IF shinyDay, THEN itsHotOutside If we know that today it is shiny, we may say that shinyDay holds, and, by the second rule above, itsHotOutside also holds. However, if we don\u0026rsquo;t know that haveTimeForProgramming also holds, we cannot infer that iAmInAGoodMood, for not all premises in the first rule hold. A rule-based system follows a similar reasoning for answering questions in this framework.\nHowever, this scheme is unsuitable for many situations, because not every deduction follows the simple schema of A IMPLIES B. Certainty factors try to introduce the concept of degree of belief, so that we may represent the case in which a fact holds with some certainty. For instance, we may say today its 80% shiny, which may be more accurate than saying it\u0026rsquo;s 100% shiny. Furthermore, we may quantify the degree of certainty we have in the validity of some rule, so that the second rule above could be\nIF shinyDay, THEN itsHotOutside, with 70% certainty The rule-based system implemented in this project includes certainty factors for determining the degree of certainty with which a conclussion holds given some facts, some inference rules, and the degree of confidence in both facts and rules.\nUses #Rule-based systems are suitable for situations in which some decissions must be taken according to some available data and to some previouly-recorded rules. For instance, they may be used in the medical domain, for determining the best treatment for some patient provided his pathologies and symptoms. The key requirement is the availability of previously recorded expert knowledge.\nThese systems have the great advantage of being highly interpretable. That is, we may check the reasoning followed for arriving to some conclussion.\n","date":"28 June 2022","permalink":"/projects/rule-based-system/","section":"","summary":"You may find this project here.","title":"Rule-Based System"},{"content":"I’m currently a student for Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Murcia, in Murcia, Spain.\nI am interested in Mathematical Optimisation and High Performance Computing.

It being developed 2 years ago means that code quality, even though decent, could be better. In particular, functions should follow the 1-screen rule (all their code should fit within 1 screen), and thus the present ones should further subdivide their functionality amongst several other subprocedures. Furthermore, C being C, Valgrind should be used for checking whether there are any memory leaks. Despite all of this, the code itself is quite neat and easy to read. I hope that the following introduction to the project, as well as the code itself, will support this assertion.\nIntroduction #The present proyect aims to develop a simple, yet functional, web server. For this matter, the server includes capabilities for handling GET request, code being modular enough for easily being extended to handle other request types.\nIn its current form, the code cosists of (1) an entry point listening to the relevan socket and reading information, (2) an HTTP module for parsing HTTP requests, (3) a debug module including functionality for creating logs during the execution of the server, and (4) a resource folder which is to be inputed as a paramater to the server executable and which contains the web content to be served. This content may have any MIME type whatsoever, and the default content stored in content/web contains a sample web page including HTML, CSS and JS files, as well as a favicon and a couple of images.\nFurthermore, this project abides to the requirements of the course for which it was developed, which were for it to be implemented in ANSI C, and to store a cookie in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser holding the number of times the webpage was visited. Should the user visit the webpage for more than this number of times, an error message would be sent as response.\nHow to execute the server #In order to execute the server, clone the repository linked above, and execute make build and make start this will build the program and execute it over the 8080 port serving the sample webpage stored in resources/web. If you want the server to run on any other port or to server content in some other folder, just run make build and then call build/out/main.out [port] [folder]. Logs created during execution are stored in resources/log/webserver.log.\nThe current makefile also includes functionality for running unit tests on the coder. For this matter, run make build_test and make test.\nA comment on the implementation #Modularity #An effort has been made for separating logical functionality of the code between different modules. In particular, all functionality for representing and parsing HTTP requests has been abstracted into an http module. This enables separation of concerns and facilitates unit testing. Furthermore, the chosen approach of structuring the module arround the processing of three data types, http_req_t, http_res_t, and http_cookie_t, in addition to being conceptually pleasant, lends itself to a very OOP style. Of course, to the extent to which C allows.\nIf further work were to be carried on the project, one further milestone in this direction would be to abstract all the socket operations into a server module, which would also offer a good opportunity for refining that code. Furthermore, it would be nice to investigate whether any C libraries allow mocking the socket functionality, since this would greatly simplify testing of this proposed new module.\nUnit Testing #Unit tests have been implemented for code in the http module leveraging the UNITY unit testing library. This is a particularly neat and light-weight library whose only requirement on the testing code is to start it by calling UNITY_BEGIN in a main function, and then defining and running tests with the macro RUN_TEST.\nLogging #All logging functionality has been abstracted into a debug module offering dg_log, dg_wrn and dg_err-level logging. Also, it was decided that this module would hold the logging file as a global variable. This choice was taken with the folowing considerations in mind:\nThis approach leads to a particularly simple implementation, its only overhead other than calling the log functions being indicating a path to the log file and closing it once finished. Should the server become parallel (which is currently not), this approach would lead to race conditions when writing the logs, since the logging file would then be a shared resource. Should one want to make this server parallel, some access control mechanism would have to be implemented in order to avoid race conditions. Further work #I can see three main lines over which this project may be extended. Roughly in order of importance, these would be:\nMaking the code more modular by abstracting all external communication into a server module. Extend the code for also handling other types of HTTP requests. Make the server parallel, by holding a pool of threads to be assigned to specific requests, so that several users may be served concurrently.
