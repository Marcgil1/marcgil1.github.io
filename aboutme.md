title:  About Me
---

I'm currently a student for Mathematics and Computer Science at
the University of Murcia, in Murcia, Spain.

I am interested in Mathematical Optimisation and High Performance
Computing. I have also an interest for AI, concretely for an area known
as Reinforcement Learning.

I also enjoy Competitive Programming, having
participated in SWERC (a competition on the southern-european level).
In these competitions, some computational problems must be solved; the
main focus being the use of efficient (and pertinent) algorithms and data
structures.

Simultaneously studying both degrees
is a quite time-consuming task, so most of the time I'm studying. When
I'm not, then I'm probably doing some of the following:

- I really enjoy learning foreign languages.
    I find the process of gradually getting some meaning out of an
    earlier-undecypherable sequence of words quite rewarding on itself.
    Also, languages never are
    isolated constructs -- learning one invariably implies getting to
    know the culture associated with it, which is also quite rewarding.
- Reading, being as avid a reader as time allows.
- Watching films.
